# Star Wars CCG Card Database  (JSON)
Welcome to the Star Wars CCG Card database! This database contains all of the current cards for Decipher's Star Wars Collectable Card Game.

For more information about Star Wars CCG, check out the SWCCG Players Committee website here: https://www.starwarsccg.org/


# Who Uses This?
This database is currently used by Scomp Link Access (https://scomp.starwarsccg.org/)

If you use this for your personal projects, please let us know so we can link ot your project!


# What data is in here?
Our goal is eventually to have everything in this database that one could need.
- Card Names
- Images
- Gametext
- Card Stats
- Characteristics
- Icons
- "Pulls X", "Pulled by X"
- Special notes for combos

Basically anything you could want to search for, it should be in here.


# Where are the images stored?
All of the images are hosted in the Holotable Git repository (https://github.com/swccgpc/holotable). This database links directly to those images.


# What does the data look like?
Here's a sample of Darth Vader from the Premiere Set:
```

# Where did all this data come from?
This database combine data from a couple different sources:
- Holotable
- SWIP

# Why Another Database?
Keeping all of the SWCCG resources all in-sync is a daunting task. Many of the previous databases have been created in a format which is not easily editable by the average-joe.  
- Holotable works with a proprietary format with carefully-placed commas which need to be placed meticulously.  
- SWIP is extremly outdated and still runs with a SQLite 2 DB, which is extremly painful to update.

Neither of the previous databases are very easy for new applications to consume. Trying to maintain those two systems is just not a good long-term solution. 


# Why JSON?
JSON is easy to read.  It's just a bunch of human-readable labels. Anybody can copy-paste a new card into the database. There are tools available to edit JSON and there are tools to validate that the JSON is properly formatted
